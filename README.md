# Contactless_Doorbell
Developed a contactless doorbell system that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of a person within a 
predefined distance and triggers a relay to ring the doorbell without physical contact. The project aims to enhance 
hygiene and safety by reducing touchpoints during doorbell use. The system was programmed using Arduino IDE with C++ 
and integrates sensor data processing with real-time actuation.
